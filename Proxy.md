##Proxy Measures
**What is a Proxy Measure?** A proxy is an indirect measure of the desired outcome which is itself strongly correlated to that outcome. It is commonly used when direct measures of the outcome are unobservable and/or unavailable. An organization should use a proxy measure when there is little or no data available about the program being implemented, but the outcome the program is designed to influence has an existing and commonly accepted proxy. GovEx has published a quick guide to proxy measures, which is available [here](https://centerforgov.gitbooks.io/benchmarking/content/Proxy.html).
